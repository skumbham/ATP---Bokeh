# Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh

Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to the exploration and utilization of Bokeh, a powerful library for creating interactive data visualizations in Python. Our repository provides insights, examples, and comprehensive guides to help you master Bokeh and integrate it into your data analysis workflow.

## What is Bokeh?

Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It is perfect for anyone looking to create complex, declarative graphics with Python efficiently.

## Installation and Setup

To start working with Bokeh in this repository, you'll need to install it first. You can do so using the following pip command:

```bash
!pip install bokeh
```

Next, to display Bokeh plots within a Jupyter notebook, make sure to include:

```python
from bokeh.io import output_notebook
output_notebook()
```

This code snippet will ensure that your Bokeh visualizations render directly within the notebook environment.

## Explore the `Bokeh_code.ipynb` Notebook

The `Bokeh_code.ipynb` notebook within this repository serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing Bokeh visualizations. It covers:
